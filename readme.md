Pi-Tag Detector
===============

We're working on re-ROS-ifying this package because `cob_fiducials` is pretty
messy to build due to its rather complicated web of dependencies.

This is a fork of the Pi-Tag fiducial marker detector in the
[`cob_fiducials`](http://wiki.ros.org/cob_fiducials) [ROS](http://www.ros.org/)
module, modified to not require ROS. Other modifications include a separate
function to just get the marker pixel coordinates instead of the pose and the
addition of the [ellipse refinement step](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00138-008-0141-3)
mentioned in the [Pi-Tag paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00138-012-0469-6).

One example marker is included in the `markers` directory, copied from
`cob_fiducials`. Others can be generated with a
[Pi-Tag generator](https://github.com/raultron/PiTag-generator).

The included test program can be invoked with `./pitag-test modelfile imagefile`,
which will print a list of detected tags and the image pixel locations of their
dots.
